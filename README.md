Project Overview: This Neural Network catergorizes and predicts price trends for the following day using the previous weeks data. These predictions are for the price of Alibaba Stock. The dataset tracks prices daily and includes the following points: date, open, close, high, low, adjusted close, and volume. The goal is to determine which past indicator is the most indicative of future trends.

Project Decision: I have been working with neural networks and financial modeling separately
for a while now, beginning in 2022 with the Nvidia workshop, I figured I would like to understand
the logic behind the magic and, hopefully, use this increased knowledge to further optimize and
perfect my own private networks.
