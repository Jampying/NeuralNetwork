Project Overview: This Neural Network weighs the significane of indicators on
foreign exchange market in predicting trends. The currency pair used will be EUR/USD

Project Decision: I have been working with neural networks and financial modeling separately
for a while now, beginning in 2022 with the Nvidia workshop, I figured I would like to understand
the logic behind the magic and, hopefully, use this increased knowledge to further optimize and
perfect my own private networks.
